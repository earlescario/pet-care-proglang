Welcome to WikiPet

The program's purpose is to provide essential information about the different types of cat and dog breeds.
This system aims to give users with comprehensive insights into each breed, encompassing their name, description, pros
and cons, and maintenance requirements. People have different preferences when it comes to selecting a pet, and the
system would be of help in providing detailed information to assist individuals in making the right decisions. As each
breed possesses unique characteristics, it significantly influences their suitability as a pet. And by making potential
owners to be aware of these traits will not only help them in their decision, but also provide the best environment for
both the owner and their future friends.
